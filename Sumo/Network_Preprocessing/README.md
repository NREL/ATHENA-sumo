Read in shapefile with info on links and nodes.\
Filter shapefile to keep columns that are useful to SUMO.\
Generate a list of nodes with traffic lights and a file with nodes and their types.\
Shows how to process the generated shapefile in SUMO to create network file.\
Show how to generate random deman on SUMO network.
