    "# Sumo Routes Sanity Check\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook runs Sumo using TraCI. All it does is send a vehicle into the network for each possible airport route (for example, North Toll Plaza to Terminal A lower curb to South Exit, etc). It records the complete route that Sumo sent that vehicle on, and the vehicle speed for each step of the simulation. This data can be visualized in the corresponding Observable Notebook, and used to sanity check the Sumo network file. For example, you may notice Sumo routing vehicles on service roads or on circuitious routes or through strange speed fluctuations. These behaviors can likely be traced to problems in the network file: Incorrect road classifications, speeds, or junctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Overview\n",
    "Some of the guts of the code has been put into traciHelper.py. The main thing you will likely want to change is the configuration file path (to change what network file the simulation will run with). You may also want to change what routes will be run and recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: For some reason traci.start will always have to retry once to begin working. You will always see a \" Retrying in 1 seconds\" line printed to the output panel at the start of a simulation. You can ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Parameters\n",
    "The only thing you should need to adjust for a new run is the path to the sumo configuration file, `configFile`. You will likely also want to specify a new results file location as well, `resultsFile`. Using a path to an existing file will __overwrite__ old results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code within traciHelper.py does make some assumptions as to the Sumo network edge names. If your new network file has new edge names for the toll plaza, curb, or exit edges then you will need to make adjustments within traciHelper.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Format\n",
    "Output will be saved to `resultsFile` in json format. The results are a dictionary. The keys to the dictionary are the route names (as generated by traciHelper.py). Route names are generally in the format _start_ To _middle_ To _end_. The values in the dictionary are an ordered array of time step statistics. For each time step for which the vehicle was in the simulation, we recorded the latitude, longitude, speed, and edge speed limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "Imagine that there was only one route we were assessing (there's normally upwards of 50). Then the results dictionary would look something like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "       \"RouteStartToRouteMiddleToRouteEnd\": [[32.86552951992726, -97.03972693649231, 10, 12],\n",
    "                                             [32.86556558448741, -97.03972482521979, 12, 12],\n",
    "                                             [32.865616915820965, -97.03972182020354, 15, 15],\n",
    "                                             [32.86568693886412, -97.0397177209373, 15, 15]]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The speeds are in __meters per second__. In this example you can see that the route took the test vehicle four time steps (also a huge underestimation). In the first time step it was driving under the speed limit of 12 meters/second, but for the other three time steps it was able to meet the speed limit."
